# Friend Circles
## 题目
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
Example 2:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
Note:
N is in range [1,200].
M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

## 分析：
### 这道题中如果一号和二号是好友，二号和三号是好友，那么一号和三号也是间接好友。<br>
### 所以可以遍历一个人的所有好友，再遍历好友的好友<br>
### 标记已经遍历的人，再积累朋友圈个数。<br>

## 代码：
```ruby
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
        int n = M.size(), res = 0;
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (visited[i]) continue;
            helper(M, i, visited);
            ++res;
        }
        return res;
    }
    void helper(vector<vector<int>>& M, int k, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[k] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < M.size(); ++i) {
            if (!M[k][i] || visited[i]) continue;
            helper(M, i, visited);
        }
    }
};
